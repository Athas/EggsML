      <h2>The interactive visualization</h2>
      <p>
      Just dive in! <b>Must be run in a full screen window</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        See <a href="food-relations.html">food-relations.html</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>The code</h2>
      <p>
        The food relations visualization is contained in a single Javascript
        file and a single CSS file:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="js/food-relations.js">js/food-relations.js</a></li>
        <li><a href="css/food-relations.css">css/food-relations.css</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Furthermore, we use the D3 and jQuery Javascript libraries.
      </p>

      <h2>Overview</h2>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        A group of computer science students at DIKU eat lunch together on a
        daily basis in the Danish-speaking lunch
        club <a href="http://eggsml.dk/">EggsML</a>.  They have done so for
        about six years with varying members.
      </p>
      <p>
        The lunch club members go to an Internet Relay Chat channel to -- among
        other things -- register lunches, register purchases, and request goods
        for future purchases.
      </p>
      <p>
        For at least the past four years, many such lunch-related actions have
        been recorded in the git repository
        at <a href="https://github.com/Athas/EggsML">https://github.com/Athas/EggsML</a>
        by an Internet Relay Chat robot residing on the lunch club channel.
        These records include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Lunches</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>The date of every lunch</li>
            <li>The participants of every lunch</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Purchases</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>The cost of every food purchase</li>
            <li>The products bought together in every purchase</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Requests</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Every food request made by EggsML's members</li>
            <li>The date and time of every such request</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        For this project, we will use only the <strong>Purchases</strong>
        and <strong>Requests</strong> data.
      </p>

      <h2>Datasets</h2>
      <p>
        Clear as they may be in purpose, the <strong>Purchases</strong>
        and <strong>Requests</strong> data are not actually <em>represented</em>
        well in their raw form; a data point is simply a git commit by the chat
        robot.  The actual data is formatted as a text string and put in the
        git commit message.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the data to be readable by any sane framework (including D3), we
        have written a set of scripts to convert the git log into JSON files.
        See the <a href="data/">data/</a> directory for the JSON datasets.  See
        the <a href="data-source/">data-source/</a> directory for the scripts.
        While the scripts do work, do not expect the code to be
        self-explanatory.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, the purpose of the scripts is not <em>just</em> to extract data
        from the git history.  We also use them to cut off data that we deem too
        useless -- data that would just make the "important data" less clear.
        We make the following simplifications:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          We don't include any ware which has been purchased less than 10 times.
          We do this to make the visualization less messy, as otherwise there
          would be about twice as many nodes, none of which would relate much to
          other wares.
        </li>
        <li>
          We don't include a bond from a ware to another ware if the probability
          of collective purchase is less than 15%.  We do this to limit the
          numbers of lines between the circles.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We have split the data into three datasets:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="data/densities.json"><code>densities.json</code></a> contains
          a list of <code>[name, amount]</code> pairs, where each pair describes
          the number of times a certain ware (from <code>name</code>) has been
          bought (from <code>amount</code>).
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="data/bonds.json"><code>bonds.json</code></a> contains a list
          of <code>[name1, name2, probability]</code> triplets, where each
          triplet describes the the <code>probability</code>
          that <code>name2</code> is bought when <code>name1</code is bought
          (and not the other way around).
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="data/temporal.json"><code>temporal.json</code></a> contains a
          list of <code>[name, timestamps]</code> pairs, where each pair
          describes the times (from <code>timestamps</code>) at which a certain
          ware (from
          <code>name</code>) has been requested.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>Note:</em> The lunch club is still active.  As such, our data is
        likely outdated by the time you review the visualization.  We use data
        extracted on January 15, 2016.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before we go on to describe our data discoveries, we need to point out a
        possible irregularity in our <code>bonds.json</code> dataset: Actually,
        the lunch chat bot does not record the purchases directly, but
        it <em>does</em> record whenever a user un-requests one or more goods.
        Since it is extremely common practice in the lunch club to un-request a
        ware once it has been bought, we have deemed that un-requesting is the
        same as purchasing.  We consider two wares to be part of the same
        purchase if they have been un-requested within 12 hours of each other.
      </p>

      <h2>Discoveries</h2>
      <p>
        We can use the visualization to determine which lunch items are the most
        popular, and which items the lunch club should maybe try to buy more of.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just by looking at the visualization, we can conclude that this lunch
        club does <em>not like their vegetables</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tomatoes, sweet tomatoes, pickles and onions are the only vegetables
        (within the set of popular wares that the visualization shows).  The
        circle of red onions ("rødløg") are bigger than the circle of ordinary
        onions ("almindelige løg") and thus more popular.
      </p>
      <p>
        The lunch club does not eat white bread.  Ryebread is by far the biggest
        item in the visualization.  For all other bread needs, there are
        Digestive biscuits and TUC biscuits.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Nutella-erstatningsprodukt</em> and <em>mini frække-deller</em> have
        a peculiar relationship.  Whilst these two goods do not make for the
        most obvious mix, we can see that whenever Nutella-erstatningsprodukt is
        bought, there is whopping 71% probability that mini frække-deller is
        also bought.  After consulting with a member of the lunch club, we have
        been told that there is indeed a member with a special affinity for both
        products.  Note that the relationship is only one-way: Whenever mini
        frække-deller is bought, there is only a 33% probability that
        Nutella-erstatningsprodukt is also bought.  This is likely due to the
        fact that mini frække-deller is bought noticably more often than
        Nutella-erstatningsprodukt, which likely means that a larger variety of
        members buy mini frække-deller, and most members don't share the
        affinity for Nutella-erstatningsprodukt.
      </p>

      <h2>Future work</h2>
      <p>
        Currently, the data scripts have to be run manually.  Then the output
        has to be copied into the correct folder, where the visualization is
        located.  In the future, we would like to have a script that does all of
        this automatically after grocery shopping.
