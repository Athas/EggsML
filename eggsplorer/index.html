      <h2>The interactive visualization</h2>
      <p>
        Just dive in!
      </p>
      <p>
        See <a href="food-relations.html">food-relations.html</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>The code</h2>
      <p>
        The food relations visualization is contained in a single Javascript
        file and a single CSS file:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="js/food-relations.js">js/food-relations.js</a></li>
        <li><a href="css/food-relations.css">css/food-relations.css</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Furthermore, we use the D3 and jQuery Javascript libraries.
      </p>

      <h2>Overview</h2>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        A group of computer science students at DIKU eat lunch together on a
        daily basis in the lunch club <a href="http://eggsml.dk/">EggsML</a>.
        They have done so for about six years with varying members.
      </p>
      <p>
        The lunch club members go to an Internet Relay Chat channel to -- among
        other things -- register lunches, register purchases, and request goods
        for future purchases.
      </p>
      <p>
        For at least the past four years, many such lunch-related actions have
        been recorded in the git repository
        at <a href="https://github.com/Athas/EggsML">https://github.com/Athas/EggsML</a>
        by an Internet Relay Chat robot residing on the lunch club channel.
        These records include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Lunches</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>The date of every lunch</li>
            <li>The participants of every lunch</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Purchases</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>The cost of every food purchase</li>
            <li>The products bought together in every purchase</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Requests</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Every food request made by EggsML's members</li>
            <li>The date and time of every such request</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        For this project, we will use only the <strong>Purchases</strong>
        and <strong>Requests</strong> data.
      </p>

      <h2>Datasets</h2>
      <p>
        Clear as they may be in purpose, the <strong>Purchases</strong>
        and <strong>Requests</strong> data are not actually <em>represented</em>
        well in their raw form; a data point is simply a git commit by the chat
        robot.  The actual data is formatted as a text string and put in the
        git commit message.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the data to be readable by any sane framework (including D3), we
        have written a set of scripts to convert the git log into JSON files.
        See the <a href="data/">data/</a> directory for the JSON datasets.  See
        the <a href="data-source/">data-source/</a> directory for the scripts.
        While the scripts do work, do not expect the code to be
        self-explanatory.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, the purpose of the scripts is not <em>just</em> to extract data
        from the git history.  We also use them to cut off data that we deem too
        useless -- data that would just make the "important data" less clear.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, we don't include any ware which has been purchased less than
        10 times.  We do this to make the visualization less messy, as otherwise
        there would be about twice as many nodes, none of which would relate much to
        other wares.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note: The lunch club is still active.  As such, our data is likely
        outdated by the time you review the visualization.  We use data
        extracted on January 15, 2016.
      </p>

      <h2>Discoveries</h2>
      <p>We can use the visualization to determine, which lunch items that are the most popular, and which items we should try to buy more of.</p>
      <p>
      As the current data filters wares that are seldomly requested, we can conclude that this lunch club does <em>not like their vegetables</em>.
      </br>
      Of all regular items, tomatoes, sweet tomatoes, pickles and onions are the only vegetables. Note, that red onions are bigger and therefore more popular than regular white onions.</p>

      <p>The lunch club does not eat white bread. Ryebread is by far the biggest item in the visualization. For all other bread needs, there are primarily Digestive- and TUC biscuits.</p>

      <p><em>Nutella-erstatningsprodukt</em> and <em>mini fr√¶kke-deller</em> has a peculiar relationship. Whilst these two lunch does not make for the most obvious mix, they seem to be bought together very often. After consulting with a member of the lunch club, we have been told that it is because of one specific member of the lunch club!<br/>
      This member has a strong preference towards these items, and therefore buys them for the club every time he is grocery shopping, to ensure that they are available.</p>.
      <h2>Future work</h2>
      <!-- add minigames -->
      Currently, the data scripts has to be run manually. Then the output has to be copied into the correct folder, where the visualization is located.<br/>
      In the future, we would like to have a script that does all of this automatically, after a grocery shopping has been done.
