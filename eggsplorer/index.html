      <h2>The visualization</h2>
      <p>
        See <a href="food-relations.html">food-relations.html</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>The code</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="js/food-relations.js">js/food-relations.js</a></li>
        <li><a href="css/food-relations.css">css/food-relations.css</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We use the D3 and jQuery Javascript libraries.
      </p>

      <h2>Overview</h2>


      <h2>Dataset</h2>
      <p>source and contents</p>
      <p>filtering input and regarding seldomly unwished items as "noise"</p>


      <p>
        See <a href="data-source/">data-source/</a> for the scripts used to
        extract data from the git history.
      </p>

      <h2>Discoveries</h2>
      <p>We can use the visualization to determine, which lunch items that are the most popular, and which items we should try to buy more of.
      As the current data filters wares that are seldomly requested, we can conclude that this lunch club does <em>not like their vegetables</em>. Of all regular items, tomatoes, sweet tomatoes, pickles and onions are the only vegetables. Note, that red onions are bigger and therefore more popular than regular white onions.</p>

      <p>The lunch club does not eat white bread. Ryebread is by far the biggest item in the visualization. For all other bread needs, there are primarily Digestive- and TUC biscuits.</p>

      <p><em>Nutella-erstatningsprodukt</em> and <em>mini fr√¶kke-deller</em> has a peculiar relationship. Whilst these two lunch does not make for the most obvious mix, they seem to be bought together very often. After consulting with a member of the lunch club, we have been told that it is because of one specific member of the lunch club!<br/>
      This member has a strong preference towards these items, and therefore buys them for the club every time he is grocery shopping, to ensure that they are available.</p>.
      <h2>Future work</h2>
