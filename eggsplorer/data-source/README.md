Data sources
============

This directory contains the scripts that extract food data from the EggsML git
log.  These data are used in the `food-relations.html` interactive
visualization.

`ønsker.sh` and `afønsker.py` extract the raw data, and the other scripts use
that to compile pratical datasets.
